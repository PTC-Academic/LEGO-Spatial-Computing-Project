# Introduction

Welcome to PTC Academic’s LEGO Spatial Computing Project! These lessons demonstrate how to connect a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime set to [Vuforia Spatial Toolbox](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia-spatial-toolbox), PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing. Vuforia Spatial Toolbox allows users to control and connect the physical world with digital interfaces through the Internet of Things, a mobile device, and a computer.

This project combines Augmented Reality, Spatial Computing and the Internet of Things, with JavaScript and an engineering concepts called a Fast Fourier Transform to analyze the vibrations produced by a LEGO SPIKE Prime rotating a "Radial Engine", or similar imperftect rotating artifact.

These documents detail the requirements necessary to complete this project and will guide users through the steps.

To view an example of what the outcome of this project may look like, check out this [![Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video](intro-video-image.png)](https://youtu.be/DtDQxQUz03o "Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video") on YouTube.
