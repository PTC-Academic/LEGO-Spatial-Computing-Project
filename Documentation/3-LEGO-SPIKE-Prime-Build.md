# LEGO SPIKE Prime Hardware Build

**Time to complete:** 10 - 20 minutes

## Hardware Requirements
LEGO SPIKE Prime kit

## Overview
This document outlines the the mechanical engineering aspects of this project. To get realistic results from the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) activity**, it's helpful to create an apparatus that vibrates between 5-50 times per second (Hz).

One way to do this is to build a LEGO structure similar to the one shown , with a off-centered mass that will cause a vibration as the motor rotates:

Another option is to bulld a more complex LEGO mechanism, like this [Radial Engine MOC at Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-3247/martijnnab/8-cylinder-radial-aircraft-engine/#details).

Here's a video of this engine in action:

Part of the **Fast Fourier Transform activity** will involve changing designs to see their effect on the FFT analysis, so more complex design ideas are encouraged!
