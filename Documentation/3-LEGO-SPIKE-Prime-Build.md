LEGO SPIKE Prime Hardware Build
```
**Time to complete**
10 - 20 minutes

**Requirements**
LEGO SPIKE Prime kit

**Font Notes:**

- All references to other portions of the project are **bold and underlined**

**Getting Started**
This portion of the project will teach how to build the system that will be used for
this project using the LEGO SPIKE Prime set. To get accurate results from the **Fast
Fourier Transform activity** , please produce a setup with the requirements listed
below. There can be additional parts to be added to the build, if chosen to do so, in
the **Learn About IOT Using Airtable** portion of this project. These will be loose
guidelines to promote creativity with the LEGO build.

If only the **Learn About IOT Using Airtable** portion of the project is going to be
completed, there is not a specific build that will need to be created for the SPIKE
Prime, but this document will create a build that can satisfy both activities.

**The Build**
To set up the LEGO SPIKE Prime set for the **Fast Fourier Transform activity** , there
are a few key parts that are needed to complete this project correctly; the LEGO
SPIKE Hub, one of the large motors, and a wheel. The SPIKE Hub is the
computerized part of the kit that will be communicating with Vuforia Spatial Toolbox
and the large motor will have the wheel connected to it which will be producing the
vibrations that will be analyzed in the Fast Fourier Transform.

It is necessary for the wheel to be weighted to simulate the different movement that
an airplane engine would go through while it is running, since the pistons would
always be moving in a different direction throughout their strokes. For this project, a
connecting link with two bricks on its end has been added to simulate a weight
while only using the LEGO SPIKE Prime Kit. Kits can be built in any way, but here is
an example of how this kit can be set up for simulating the motion of an airplane
engine. Just remember to place the wheel high enough off the ground so that it can
properly rotate without interference.

Part of the **Fast Fourier Transform activity** will involve changing designs to see their
effect on the FFT analysis, so multiple design ideas are encouraged!
