**Total time to complete**
2 - 3 hours

Welcome to PTC’s LEGO Spatial Computing Project! These lessons will instruct
users how to connect a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime set to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox,
PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing. Vuforia Spatial
Toolbox allows users to control and connect the physical world with digital
interfaces through the Internet of Things, a mobile device, and a computer. There
will be a full deep dive on Vuforia Spatial Toolbox later in the project, but please
check out the product’s home page for a brief overview of it to start.

In addition to augmented reality, spatial computing, and the Internet of Things,
students will familiarize themselves with JavaScript, engineering concepts like Fast
Fourier Transforms, and much more over the course of this project.

This document will map out the requirements that are necessary to complete this
project and provide a table of contents for what to expect to be working on
throughout these lessons.

To view an example of what the outcome of this project will look like, check out this
FFT Activity and Learn About IOT Using Airtable video on YouTube.

For troubleshooting, check out the Vuforia Spatial Toolbox forum. It is monitored
regularly by members of the PTC Spatial Toolbox team and members of the forum
community.

For anybody interested in the actual radial engine that inspired this project, check it
out on Rebrickable.
