# LEGO-Spatial-Computing-Project
Welcome to PTC’s LEGO Spatial Computing Project! These lessons will instruct users how to connect a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime set to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing.  

For the Mac version of this project, use the [SpatialToolbox-Mac-Interns Repository](https://github.com/PTC-Academic/SpatialToolbox-Mac-Interns)  

For the Windows version of this project, use the [SpatialToolbox-Windows-Interns Repository](https://github.com/PTC-Academic/SpatialToolbox-Windows-Interns)
