# LEGO-Spatial-Computing-Project
Welcome to PTC’s LEGO Spatial Computing Project! These lessons will instruct users how to connect a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime set to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing.  

This video shows an example of what the outcome of this project may look like (click image for full video and explanation on Youtube): [![Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video](https://github.com/PTC-Academic/LEGO-Spatial-Computing-Project/blob/master/Documentation/images/intro-video.gif)](https://youtu.be/DtDQxQUz03o "Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video")
