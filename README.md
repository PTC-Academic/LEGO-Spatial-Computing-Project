# PTC Education LEGO Spatial Computing Project
These tutorials demonstrate how to connect a [LEGO Education SPIKE Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-us/meetspikeprime#science) to [Vuforia Spatial Toolbox](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia-spatial-toolbox), PTC’s latest solution for **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Spatial Computing**. Vuforia Spatial Toolbox allows users to control and connect the physical world with AR. Please reach out to us at EduTech[at]ptc.com with any questions.

### Example Outcome

### Educational Approach
This project combines AR, Spatial Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), with JavaScript and an algorithm called a [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)(FFT) to analyze the vibrations produced by a LEGO SPIKE Prime rotating a LEGO-built [Radial Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine). It is intended for students across engineering and computer science. All of the software tools utilized in this project are **free and open source**.

These tutorials include a high level of detail, and are intended to provide a supported first experience for students new to AR, IoT and Spatial Computing.
