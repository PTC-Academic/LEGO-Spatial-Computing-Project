# LEGO Spatial Computing Project
Welcome to PTC’s LEGO Spatial Computing Project! These lessons will instruct users how to connect a LEGO Education SPIKE Prime set to Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing.

This video shows an example of what the outcome of this project may look like (click image for full video and explanation on Youtube): [![Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video](https://github.com/PTC-Academic/LEGO-Spatial-Computing-Project/blob/master/images/intro-video.gif)](https://youtu.be/DtDQxQUz03o "Intro LEGO Spatial Computing FFT video")

This exercise demonstrates how to connect a [LEGO Education SPIKE Prime](https://education.lego.com/en-us/meetspikeprime#science) to [Vuforia Spatial Toolbox](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia-spatial-toolbox), PTC’s latest solution for augmented reality and spatial computing. Vuforia Spatial Toolbox allows users to control and connect the physical world with Augmented Reality (AR).

This project combines AR, Spatial Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), with JavaScript and an algorithm called a [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)(FFT) to analyze the vibrations produced by a LEGO SPIKE Prime rotating a LEGO-built [Radial Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine).

For additional help with Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, check out the [Vuforia Spatial Toolbox forum](https://forum.spatialtoolbox.vuforia.com/). It is monitored regularly by the PTC Spatial Toolbox team and the spatial computing community.
